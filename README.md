# midjourney-polygen-portrait
A polygen grammar to generate Midjourney AI portrait prompts

As a backend it uses the 'polygen' tool from http://www.polygen.org

You would run it like this:

polygen midjourney-portrait.grm 

and it generates the following output:

"a heartbreakingly beautiful african girl wearing an indigo kimono on a bed holding a book" 

which can then be fed to the Midjourney AI to generate a portrait
